# Nmax6
This repository contains TBMEs obtained from the NCSM results for 18F with Daejeon16 interaction at hw=14 MeV via the Okubo-Lee-Suzuki similarity transformation.

DJ16_4.int  contains TBMEs obtained from the NCSM results with the bare Daejeon16 potential at Nmax=4
DJ16_6.int  contains TBMEs obtained from the NCSM results with the bare Daejeon16 potential at Nmax=6
DJ16_6A.int is based on DJ16_6.int + includes modified monopoles
DJ16_6B.int is based on DJ16_6A.int + includes a few modified quadrupole pairing TBMEs (in the T=0 channel)
